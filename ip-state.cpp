// @I/O @I/0-state

// An iostream has a state that we can examine to determine whether an operation succeeded.
// In general, the I/O state holds all the information needed to read or write, such as 
// formatting information, 
// error state (e.g., has end-of-input been reached?), and
// what kind of buffering is used.

// In particular, a user can set the state to reflect that an error has occurred and clear the state if an error wasnâ€™t serious.
