     // Without that ref(), some_vec would be passed by value.

     // The compiler checks that the first argument can be invoked given the following arguments and 
     // builds the necessary function object to pass to the thread.

     // if F::operator()() and f() perform the same algorithm, 
     // the handling of the two tasks are roughly equivalent: 
     // in both cases, a function object is constructed for the thread to execute.
